  <h1>Most Populer Freelancing Marketplace</h1>
  <h2>Number 01: Upwork</h2>
  <p>Upwork (previously oDesk and Elance) is possibly one of the largest freelancing marketplaces for projects. You name any expertise, and you will perhaps see projects and freelancers related to it. Apart from a wide variety of technology, it also has shorter-term projects, longer-term projects, entry-level projects. Moreover, for seasoned freelancers, expert-level high paying projects</p>
  <h2>Number 02: PeoplePerHour</h2>
  <p>The site offers all-around freelancers and outsourcing marketplace with a wide range of categories like Web Design, Video, Audio, Web Development, Sales & Marketing, Support, Writing, Translation, Social media, Software Development, Mobile Development.</p>
  <h2>Number 03:Fiverr</h2>
  <p>Fiverr is a different kind of freelancing website and a marketplace for freelancers. Freelancers post what they can offer for $5 (five-rr), and clients can search for them and order.

    Don’t worry, you don’t have to offer everything for $5, and you can always have additional perks for a higher price.
    
    Fiverr fees are a lot higher than Upwork / Freelancer. They charge $1 per $5 gig or 20%.</p>
    <h2>Number 04:Freelancer.com</h2>
    <p>If I remember correctly, Freelancer was started as GetAFreelancer and was more commonly known as GAF. They acquired many freelancing websites known to me — sites like ScriptLance, vWorker (Previously RentACoder), to name a few.

      It is quite a big marketplace — possibly second best to Upwork. Upwork quotes as having 4+ Million clients on their home page and Freelancer quotes as Millions of small businesses use them.</p>
      <h2>Number 05:Linkedin</h2>
      <p>Unquestionably the most important social networking site for professionals with a lot of employment offers. There are millions of jobs (Mostly full time but few part-time) job offers daily.

        If you find a position fitting right for your expertise, you can always apply for it.
        
        </p>
        <h2>Number 06:Guru</h2>
        <p>Guru is yet another marketplace for finding jobs and projects. They have a straightforward hiring process, and so it makes it easy for the clients to hire freelancers. It is comparatively a smaller marketplace.

          So we don’t see many freelancers as compared to upwork / freelancer. It makes it less price competitive. Apart from that, Guru has a Workroom feature, which makes it easy to manage all the jobs.</p>
